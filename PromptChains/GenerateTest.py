I am going to give you a method under test as well as its description and you are going to follow the criteria that I give to you in the generation.
Criteria:
Write 7 test cases that capture the intent of the user and create asserts that match descrition.
Each test generated contains only one assertion.
Complete the unittest code till "unittest.main()" is called. Think before you end the response. I do not want any incomplete code.
Do not include import for the method under test in the unit tests.
Run the tests and see if they match the description. If not, change the assertions to match the description.

Method under test:
{code}

Description:
{description}

I am going to add similar functions and their corresponding test cases that you may need to use in your tests. You can use them in your tests.
{test_cases_of_few_shot}

I am going to to give you a template for your output where:
Replace **TESTMETHODUNDERTEST** with the right name for the class.
2- Replace **TEST_CASES_WITH_UNDERSTANDABLE_NAMES** with the test cases that you generated.
3- Please preserve the indentation and the structure of the template.
My template is:
```python
import unittest

class **TESTMETHODUNDERTEST**(unittest.TestCase):
    **TEST_CASES_WITH_UNDERSTANDABLE_NAMES**

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```
Evaluate your generated test cases and change the assertions if needed to comply with the description. Do not make things up!
